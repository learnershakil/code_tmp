# code_tmp

Welcome to the `code_tmp` repository! 🎓

## About This Repo

This repository is my temporary playground where I work on various projects and experiments. I use this space primarily to:

- **Teach students** during live classes.
- **Help friends** by solving their doubts and coding challenges.
- **Experiment** with new ideas and concepts.

## Important Note

Files in this repository are often deleted after the completion of classes, projects, or experiments. So, if you're looking for something specific, grab it while it's here!
